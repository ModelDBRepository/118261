This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Ursino M, Cuppini C, Magosso E, Serino A, di Pellegrino G (2009)
Multisensory integration in the superior colliculus: a neural
network model. J Comput Neurosci 26:55-73

This archive contains many matlab programs to run the audiovisual
multisensory model, to generate input and synapses and to make
figures.

A brief description of some of the program files:

	rete2D_A_V_SC		This is the file which contains the model

	USE_THE_MODEL		This is the file which allows the single
                        simulations to be run

	inputvisivo
	campirecettivi_visivo
	input acusticofig
	campirecettivi_acustico  These four files are used to generate the
                             inputs and the receptive fields of the
                             unimodal areas
	L_auditory
	L_visual 
	L_SC           These three files generate the intra area synapses

The files named "generate" and "macro" are used to generate data
which are used in the files "graph" and "macro"
The files named "graph" and "macro" are used to generate the figures
you can find in the paper. 

We have not included macros to generate Figure 9 since it was quite complex,
requiring many parameter changes.

For example Graphs_Fig11b will produce

<img src="fig11btop.jpg" alt="fig11b top">
<img src="fig11bmid.jpg" alt="fig11b middle">
<img src="fig11bbot.jpg" alt="fig11b bottom">

These matlab files were contributed by Dr Ursino.
